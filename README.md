Live Train Schedule System
The system is meant to be able to perform the following functions:
This is a train scheduling application where user can add train information and display it in real time.
There is a table that displays the train schedule for user to view real time information about each train
User is presented with a form that contains train name, destination, arrival time and time left for the train to arrive below the schedule table 
Access to the application is based on user login via google or git hub account
Logged-in user can edit existing train schedule information
Logged-in user can also delete exiting train schedule details
Using Firebase and Moment.js technologies, user can manipulate train schedule details.
When user submits train schedule details, it appears immediately on the schedule table
Javascript event listener was triggered when user clicks on the submit button, values from the input field are pushed to Firebase
Outstanding Task
1 - Ability to edit train schedule information by loggedIn user 
2 - Ability to delete an existing train schedule information by loggedIn user 
3- Restrict user who has not logged in to either google account or Git hub access to the application
